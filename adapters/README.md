# Adapters
Instead of adding a ton of jumpers to the module with the aim of accounting for every system known to man, I instead chose to leave those details up to the adapter. The documentation, specificly [adapters](https://github.com/tebl/C64-JoyKEY/blob/main/documentation/adapters.md) include some more general details on usage and assembly.

For BOM, parts needed on putting it together is found in the relevant subfolder READMEs.
