# Faceplates
The *C64 JoyKEY* will have a selection of faceplates, these are primarily just here to make the device a bit prettier by hiding the actual electronics. Secondly it adds some rigidity to the design, quite possibly making it less likely to fail after heavy use. Check out [faceplate]-section for designs available, but as always you can find these and other PCBs on [PCBWay shared projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/?tag=C64%20JoyKEY).

## Faceplate variations (A/B)
The faceplates generally come in two different variations, A and B with a number added to further separate the various designs. The A version has a larger PCB cutout that should allow you to use most of Cherry MX-compatible keycaps of the kind that descends down past the actual switch, if you're in doubt this is the version to get. The B designs have a smaller cutout, but this will only work with keycaps that don't have any overhang when the key is pushed (it'd bottom out and hit the faceplate).
