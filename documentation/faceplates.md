# Faceplates
The *C64 JoyKEY* will have a selection of faceplates, these are primarily just here to make the device a bit prettier by hiding the actual electronics. Secondly it adds some rigidity to the design, quite possibly making it less likely to fail after heavy use. Check out [faceplate]-section for designs available, but as always you can find these and other PCBs on [PCBWay shared projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/?tag=C64%20JoyKEY).

## Faceplate variations (A/B)
These generally come in two different variations, A and B with a number added to separate the various designs. The A version has a larger PCB cutout that should allow you to use most of Cherry MX-compatible keycaps of the kind that descends down past the actual switch (low/medium profile), if you're in doubt this is the version to get. The B designs have a smaller cutout, but requires the use of keycaps that don't descend so far down (high profile).

### Keycaps A
The keycaps pictured below were bought from AliExpress though you'll undoubtedly find them on any site that sells similar Chinese goods, a likely candidate is Wish and ebay. I don't want to include a direct link to a listing as those are bound to disappear by the time anyone reads this. The blue ones (also comes in silver and gold I thing) were listed as *low profile Cherry MX compatible gaming* keycaps, usually also listed as mechanical keyboard keycaps. The ones on the right were listed as *PBT 1u gaming Cherry MX* keycaps, available in several colours - if you want to add your own labels these are the ones I'd recommend. Both were in the 10$ price range.

### Keycaps B
These I fell in love with when I saw them, listed as *round steampunk typewriter keycaps* - I thing I got a complete set for a keyboard for under 10$. I think these are what are called *high profile* keycaps, but I'm a bit fuzzy the specifics as just about everything I've bought have been badly-described Chinese products. The ones shown below are the ones I have, and as you might've guessed I designed a new faceplate so that there wouldn't be such a huge gap.
